# Heart-Disease-Prediction

In this project, Machine Learning is used to predict whether a person is suffering from a heart disease.

Data Source: Kaggle

Data Visulaization : colorbar , histogram , plots

Data Processing: generated dummy variables for categorical features and scaled other features 

Machine Learning algorithms 
 1.  `K Neighbors Classifier`
 2.  `Support Vector Classifier`
 3.  `Decision Tree Classifier`
 4.  `Random Forest Classifier`.
  
### Result
1. parameters were across each model to improve their scores.
2. `K Neighbors Classifier` achieved the highest score of `87%` with `8 nearest neighbors`
